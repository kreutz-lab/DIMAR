The test data are small excerpts of real-world data sets from our cooperations partners that are used to test the implementation. The biological background or other details can therefore not be specified here. For further data sets refer to e.g. the [ProteomeXchange](http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset) or the [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive) databases.
